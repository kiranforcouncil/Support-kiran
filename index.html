Dear Honorable Council Members,

I am writing to express my strong support for the appointment of Mr. Kiran Agrahara to fill the current vacancy on the Robbinsville Town Council. Mr. Agrahara's exceptional dedication to our community, combined with his unique and persistent efforts in seeking public office and civic engagement, make him a highly deserving candidate.

Commitment to Public Service and Engagement

Mr. Agrahara’s commitment to Robbinsville is proven through both his electoral efforts and his regular civic participation. He mounted serious campaigns for the Town Council in 2021 and 2023, securing more than 20% of the vote in these elections. Crucially, his campaign efforts included personally knocking on over 3,000 doors, successfully connecting with and listening to the concerns of a substantial portion of our community.

Beyond the campaign trail, Mr. Agrahara has demonstrated continuous responsibility by:

• Consistently participating in Town Council and School Board public meetings to stay informed and represent citizen concerns.
• Graduating as a member of the inaugural Adult Citizen Police Academy, strengthening community policing and understanding between residents and law enforcement.

Active Community Leadership, Health, and Philanthropy

Mr. Agrahara’s leadership is further defined by his actions that directly benefit local families and public health:

• Public Health Initiative: Actively working with a local Robbinsville pharmacy to provide a free flu clinic.
• Educational and Safety Support: Since 2022, providing scholarships to Robbinsville High School seniors, contributing to the CARE program, organizing the annual Thanksgiving Turkey Drive, and donating to the Robbinsville Police Department Coat Drive.

Ensuring Balanced Representation

With Mike Todd becoming Mayor-elect, the majority of current Council representation is concentrated in and around the Town Center—specifically Districts 1, 4, 7, 8, and 9. In contrast, Districts 2, 3, 5, and 6—representing approximately 40–45 percent of Robbinsville’s population—are underrepresented.

Appointing Mr. Agrahara would help restore balance and ensure these districts have a strong, informed, and engaged voice on the Council. His familiarity with district-level issues and broad community outreach uniquely position him to advocate effectively for residents who are currently underserved in township governance.

Mr. Agrahara is a highly visible, dedicated, and action-oriented community advocate. His sustained commitment to civic engagement, public health, and direct community outreach makes him the ideal choice to serve on the Town Council.

Thank you for considering this highly qualified individual for appointment.

Sincerely,
